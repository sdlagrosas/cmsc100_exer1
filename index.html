<h5>I liked CMSC 22 the most so far because I enjoyed creating games</h5>
<h5>WIKA1 has made me more appreciative of varying Filipino languages and it is a GE course that is less heavy compared to others</h5>
<h5>I don't have a favorite PL right now but if I were to write a program on the go, it would be in C</h5>
<h5>Carbonara and Lasagna</h5>
